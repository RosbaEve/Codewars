You drop a ball from a given height. 
After each bounce, the ball returns to some fixed proportion of its previous height. 
If the ball bounces to height 1 or less, we consider it to have stopped bouncing. 
Return the number of bounces it takes for the ball to stop moving.

Initial height is an integer in range [2,1000]

Bouncing Proportion is a decimal in range [0, 1]
